# Assignment 2
## Katie Broniste


I decided to take Web Development class based on the encouragement of my advisor. I was needing more upper level classes to fit with my online schedule and she felt that this would be a good fit.

Three things I have learned include:

    1. How complicated the internet truly is and how we take
     its easy access for granted.
    2. How much easier Microsoft Word makes our lives, but it
     has made us na√Øve to how it works.
    3. I have learned that there is allot more that goes on
     behind the scenes in our computers that we do not even
     realize or comprehend.
    4. **Bonus** I have realized how much this course is going
    to challenge me and likely be my most difficult class
    this semester. With determination and plenty of time
    studying I will succeed.
