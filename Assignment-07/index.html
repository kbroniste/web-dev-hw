<!---In the "lyrics" section, add the song lyrics using
 what you know of HTML paragraphs. --->
<p>You could never know what it's like<br>
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice<br>
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you<br>
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use<br>
<br>
And did you think this fool could never win?<br>
Well look at me, I'm coming back again<br>
I got a taste of love in a simple way<br>
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away<br>
<br>
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did<br>
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid<br>
I'm still standing after all this time<br>
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind<br>
<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
Once I never could hope to win<br>
You starting down the road leaving me again<br>
The threats you made were meant to cut me down<br>
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now<br>
<br>
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did<br>
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid<br>
I'm still standing after all this time<br>
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind<br>
<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did<br>
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid<br>
I'm still standing after all this time<br>
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind<br>
<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm still standing, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>
