<h1><em>Why Me Lord</em></h1>
<h3><i> By Kris Kristofferson</i></h3>

<div class="about">
<p> My inspiration for this song, is my dad. My dad used to be in a band and would<br>
   close every show with this song. Since he has passed, this song has taken on more <br>
   meaning and has become more special to myself and my family.

<div class="lyric">
<p><pre>Why me Lord,<em> what have I ever done</em>
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures I've known
<em>Tell me Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth loving you</em>
Or the kindness you've shown.</pre></p>
<br>
<p><pre><em>Lord help me Jesus</em>, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.</pre></p>
<br>
<p><pre>Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay
All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself
<em>On my way back to you</em>.</pre></p>
<br>
<p><pre><em>Lord help me Jesus</em>, I've wasted it so
Help me Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've need you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand.</pre></p>
