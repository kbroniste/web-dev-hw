1. My imaginary client was a small town groomer. They described their site needing to have information about their services, wanted online scheduling of appointments, also wanted to include links about why grooming your pet is beneficial for them. They had not provided me with images or with the details of the information they wanted provided. They agreed to let me use images of my pets to fill the space, until they could get their information to me.

2. Block: gives a block display, usually vertical.

    Inline: keeps information displayed in a straight line.

    Inline-block: keeps information in a horizontal line and also resembles blocks.

3. For this assignemnt, I attempted to build a sketch. But, I found that my work flow went a little smoother without it. Seemed to take up more time to try and sketch it out vs building it, as the client gave me the basics they wanted for their site.
