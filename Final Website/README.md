## *A Women's Survival Guide to Dating in the Modern World*

This is a blog that I have been working on throughout the semester. I have been able to practice my skills more thoroughly by working on this website.

I'll be honest. I started out this semester despising this class. I would put off working on the assignments until the last minute. I have always struggled with technology and how it works.

However, once we started building sites, I became addicted. I actually found myself getting lost and spending hours to a whole day on just one assignment, without realizing it. This class has easily become my favorite class this semester! Because of this class, I am even debating on taking another web dev class in the future.
