1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

With learning HTML, it was all new information. At first it was difficult, but the more I worked it and played around with it on the side, it began to make sense. I find that I am able to incorporate each skill, with ease.

2. Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am anxious to learn CSS. I have watched a few videos regarding using CSS and I was unable to follow along. However, I had the same problem at first with HTML. I am hoping that the more I use it, the easier it will become.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

My work cycle for this assignment, was similar to my prior assignments. I start with creating the basic HTML pages, then start adding the details of what I wanted to include, then go back and style it.
