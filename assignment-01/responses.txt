1. The internet is a global network system of networks that is used to access the Web,
a collaboration of information. 

2. The internet works by using a server connected to another server using an 
underground wire. Each computer has its own unique IP address such as 1.2.3.4.
Our computers are considered clients that connect to the internet server provider (ISP). 
Information provided on the internet is broken down into smaller packets, so it is easier
translated. 

3.A directory is the folder that contains the files. 
 
4. VCS stands for version control, which is a system that monitors and records changes
to files overtime so you can recall them later. It is like autosave in video games.
