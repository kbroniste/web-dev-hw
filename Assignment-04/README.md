1. The site that I visited was aol.com using The Wayback Machine. What I noticed about the 10 year difference is, back in 2010 we had less options to sort our e-mail. Now our email is sorted into social, updates, promotions, and inbox helping us to navigate and find mail we want to open. Back in 2010 it was easy for our e-mails to get lost or overlooked.  

2. Using the GIT Module I found allot easier than uploading each file in the end. I like being able to connect my files from Atom to GITHUB. The thing I struggled with the most was trying to open the repo directly into Atom from GIT. After watching the tutorial a few times, it made sense and I am now able to open my files easily.
