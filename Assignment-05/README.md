1. How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

You can only have <head> and one <body> element in a page. The <head> element is the information about the page, not visible to viewers. The body element is the visual aspect that viewers will see.

2. Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup includes headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists that are used to embed information on the page.

Semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information being presented on the page.


3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

My work cycle for this assignment involved reading over the information and referencing the book, to clarify and assure myself I was coding the page correctly. I would work through the steps and different headings, laying a basic foundation for the page, then I went back and added the more in depth information. I would constantly save my work and check how it appeared as a page. Then I would catch an error or an area that needed more work and go correct it.

This is the first assignment I felt confident in my knowledge to not go step by step with the walkthrough.
