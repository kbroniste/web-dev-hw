1. Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal- applies to the whole document.

Element- applies to a specific element such as h1, h2, or p.

Class- applies to the <div> class only. This will apply to that section on the page. This helps to separate information on the page.

Id- will applies to the <div> id. This is the most specific and helps to further design and help this selector to stand out.

2. Briefly discuss your color palette, including the 3 colors you chose. List their color names, rgb values, or hex codes.

The colors I chose were to help the document stand out. My h1 I used brown, as it went good with the orange back ground. I chose rgb(199, 146, 0) as it is my favorite color and worked well with the other colors chosen. I chose rgb(0,0,0) with a shadow of rgb(208, 214, 209) for Rocky. His colors are black with grey blending in as his age begins to show. I chose rgb(82, 87, 83) with a text shadow of rgb(209, 227, 212) as Mowgli's color will be silver once he is full grown.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

My work cycle for this assignment involved implementing the use of my Chromecast, that way I would be able to see my work as it was coming along. I was also able to keep the website open, for easier access to notes as I began coding. I found myself referencing our book frequently as I tried to remember how to do several things.
