          <p><i>This is a brief interduction to my little pack. I firmly believe that my pups were destined for me and found me at my darkest times. They have stood by my side through many trials and helped keep me going.</i></p>

<p>Rocky is a 10 year old Australian Sheppart/Black Lab mix. He joined the pack back in 2017. Rocky enjoys car rides and rolling in the grass on sunny days. He absolutley hates water and rain. However, he can be found burying his head in the snow on a nice day. Rocky enjoys the simple things in life, mostly frequent naps cuddled up to his favorite humans. Rocky gets to spend his days enjoying his golden years with frequent treats, belly rubs, and snuggles. He loves to sleep in the recliner in the living room. But his favorite spot is in bed, underneath all the covers, with his girl. He even has his own pillow.</p>
