# Assignment 06
## Kate Broniste

1. Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

The most common type of form I come across would be text and selection. Text is used for example to log into Facebook. Selection is used commonly in quizzes for classes.


2. List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

text- Text is used to input words such as name, passwords, emails, comments, etc.

selection- Selection provides a dropdown box that allows users to choose from a list. This is handy with picking years, states, days, times, etc.

button- The most common button would be the submit button.

You could find all these aspects when looking to book a reservation, making a purchase of tickets, or signing up for something.


3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

My work process started with laying out the basics of the page. Then I reviewed what was required with the assignment. After reviewing the assignment, I began to edit my page to meet the requirements. Pretty soon I found myself down the rabbit hole and spending my whole day editing my page and resorting to looking up techniques or code in my book to make happen what I was hoping to achieve. There was one code I was unable to figure out. But, I am hoping as time goes on, I will learn and continue building on the knowledge I am gaining each week.
